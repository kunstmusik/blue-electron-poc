# Implementation Plan: Sound Score Object Editor Parity

**Branch**: `039-sound-score-object-editor` | **Date**: 2026-05-11 | **Spec**: [/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/specs/039-sound-score-object-editor/spec.md](/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/specs/039-sound-score-object-editor/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/specs/039-sound-score-object-editor/spec.md`

## Summary

Replace the current `Sound` comment-only auxiliary surface with a Java Blue-style tabbed editor that covers Interface, Automation, and Comments, and add a scoped test-preview workflow. The implementation should reuse the existing Spec 037 score-object editor shell and earlier BSB interface work instead of introducing a parallel editor stack.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.8.x, React 19.x, Electron 35.x, strict monorepo packages  
**Primary Dependencies**: Spec 037 score-object editor infrastructure, Spec 038 closeout baseline, Specs 022 and 023 BSB interface work, `@blue/data` `Sound` and automation models, existing Electron-backed test-preview flow from `External`, Dockview 5.2.0, Zustand 5.x, Vitest 4.x  
**Storage**: canonical `Sound` state remains in main-process `BlueData`; editor-local tab state and transient modal state remain renderer-local  
**Testing**: Vitest renderer, shared-contract, and main-process coverage plus `pnpm --filter @blue/app test`, `pnpm --filter @blue/app build:renderer`, and `git diff --check`  
**Target Platform**: Electron desktop on macOS first  
**Project Type**: app-layer parity feature extending the existing score-object auxiliary editor infrastructure  
**Performance Goals**: tab switches and test-preview open/close cycles should remain immediate; BSB and automation surfaces should update only for the active selection  
**Constraints**: preserve Java `.blue` compatibility, reuse existing BSB infrastructure, keep canonical writes inside shared score patch plumbing, and leave `PianoRoll` and `JMask` work to Specs 040 and 041  
**Scale/Scope**: one heavyweight score-object editor family plus its supporting payload, tests, and preview flow

## Constitution Check

- **Data-First, UI-Separated**: PASS. Canonical `Sound` state stays in `@blue/data` and shared patch helpers; tabs and modal visibility stay renderer-local.
- **Backwards-Compatible Serialization**: PASS. All edits continue to flow through canonical score patches and XML-backed models.
- **JVM Dependencies Preserved, Not Replaced**: PASS. Java Blue `SoundEditor` and its child panels remain the parity source.
- **Engine as External Process**: PASS. The slice reuses the existing editor-side preview/test pattern and does not change engine architecture.
- **Test-First for Serialization**: PASS. The plan adds payload and mutation coverage before parity is claimed.
- **Research Integration**: PASS. The design explicitly reuses the existing BSB and score-object editor infrastructure.

**Structure Decision**: Keep the Spec 037 score-object editor shell, replace the current `SoundObjectEditor.tsx` placeholder with a tabbed editor, and reuse BSB plus preview infrastructure instead of inventing new UI primitives.

## Post-Design Constitution Check

- **Data-First, UI-Separated**: PASS. Canonical `Sound` edits remain patch-driven and renderer-local tab state stays isolated.
- **Backwards-Compatible Serialization**: PASS. No renderer-owned persistence is introduced.
- **JVM Dependencies Preserved, Not Replaced**: PASS. The plan is anchored to Java `SoundEditor` behavior and layout.
- **Engine as External Process**: PASS. The preview flow remains an editor-side action, not a transport change.
- **Test-First for Serialization**: PASS. Contract, renderer, and mutation tests are required before parity is claimed.
- **Research Integration**: PASS. The plan reuses earlier BSB work and the Spec 037 editor shell instead of diverging from established seams.
