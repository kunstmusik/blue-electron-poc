# Feature Specification: Sound Score Object Editor Parity

**Feature Branch**: `039-sound-score-object-editor`  
**Created**: 2026-05-11  
**Status**: Complete
**Input**: User description: "Split the old grouped Tier 2 score-object follow-up so `Sound` gets its own deeper planning slice, with explicit Java Blue UI/UX analysis reflected in the task breakdown."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Work Inside Sound's Real Tabbed Editor (Priority: P1)

As a composer using `Sound` score objects, I need the auxiliary editor to expose the real Java Blue tabbed workflow so I can move between interface editing and comments without being limited to a plain textarea.

**Why this priority**: The current renderer only exposes `comment`, which means one of blue's most important score-object types is still effectively not editable.

**Independent Test**: Select a `Sound` object, switch between the Interface and Comments tabs, edit supported content in both tabs, and verify the canonical object updates while the score selection and editor shell remain stable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a `Sound` object is selected, **When** the score-object editor opens, **Then** it shows a deliberate tabbed editor shell modeled on Java Blue rather than a comment textarea only.
2. **Given** the user edits supported interface or comment content, **When** the edit commits, **Then** the canonical `Sound` object updates through shared score patch plumbing and the editor document refreshes coherently.

### User Story 2 - Edit Automation Curves From The Same Surface (Priority: P1)

As a composer automating a `Sound` score object, I need the automation panel and line-editing workflow in the same auxiliary editor so I can manage parameter curves without leaving the score workflow.

**Why this priority**: Java Blue treats automation as a first-class tab in the `Sound` editor, and leaving it out would still leave the score-object editor materially incomplete.

**Independent Test**: Open the Automation tab for a `Sound` object with parameters, select a parameter, edit supported line data, and verify the score object and editor preview remain synchronized.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a `Sound` object exposes automatable parameters, **When** the Automation tab opens, **Then** the editor shows a deliberate parameter-selection and curve-editing workflow instead of a placeholder message.
2. **Given** the user edits a supported automation curve or enablement state, **When** the change is committed, **Then** the canonical automation data updates and the active document redraws against the new state.

### User Story 3 - Test Generated Sound Output Without Leaving The Editor (Priority: P2)

As a composer validating a `Sound` object, I need the Java-style test action so I can audition or inspect generated score output directly from the auxiliary editor.

**Why this priority**: The test action is a meaningful part of the Java workflow and helps keep the parity claim honest when interface and automation edits are added.

**Independent Test**: Trigger the Sound test action from the editor, review the generated score output or failure message, and confirm the action stays scoped to the selected target.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a supported `Sound` object is selected, **When** the user invokes the test action, **Then** the app shows generated score output or a deliberate error state from the selected target.
2. **Given** unsupported subfeatures remain, **When** the user encounters them in the editor or test flow, **Then** the UI shows explicit deferred messaging rather than silently dropping data.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a `Sound` object has no BSB widgets or no automatable parameters?
- What happens when Java Blue exposes automation curve data that the TypeScript surface can preserve but not yet edit fully?
- What happens when the selected `Sound` object is removed while the test dialog or tabbed editor is open?
- What happens when the test action fails because the selected object cannot generate valid score text?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The implementation MUST review the Java Blue `SoundEditor` UI/UX anchors before coding begins, including `SoundEditor`, `AutomationPanel`, `TimeBar`, `LineCanvas`, and `LineListComboBoxModel`.
- **FR-002**: The score-object editor document contract MUST grow a dedicated `SoundEditorSnapshot` instead of reusing the current comment-only structured payload.
- **FR-003**: The renderer MUST provide a tabbed `Sound` editor workflow that covers Interface, Automation, and Comments as distinct surfaces.
- **FR-004**: The Interface tab MUST reuse the existing BSB interface infrastructure from earlier orchestra and BSB specs where practical instead of creating a second widget system.
- **FR-005**: The Automation tab MUST expose supported parameter selection, line editing, and enablement behavior that maps back to canonical `Sound` automation data.
- **FR-006**: The editor MUST expose a test action that previews generated score output or a deliberate error state for the selected `Sound` target.
- **FR-007**: Canonical writes MUST continue to flow through shared score patch plumbing; renderer-only state such as the selected tab MAY remain local to the editor shell.
- **FR-008**: Unsupported or deferred `Sound` subfeatures MUST be surfaced explicitly so the parity claim remains honest.
- **FR-009**: The implementation MUST add tests covering `Sound` document creation, tab routing, supported mutations, removed-target fallback behavior, and the test-action flow it claims.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **SoundEditorSnapshot**: The typed auxiliary-editor payload for `Sound`, including tab metadata plus interface, automation, and comment sub-surfaces.
- **SoundAutomationSnapshot**: The renderer-facing view of available automation parameters, selected line state, supported curve data, and any deferred capabilities.
- **SoundTestPreview**: The scoped result of invoking the editor-side test action, including generated score text or a deliberate failure message.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A reviewer can select a `Sound` object and use a tabbed editor shell instead of a comment textarea only.
- **SC-002**: A reviewer can edit supported `Sound` automation data from the auxiliary editor and observe coherent canonical updates.
- **SC-003**: A reviewer can invoke the `Sound` test action and receive either generated score text or an explicit failure state tied to the selected target.
- **SC-004**: Automated tests cover the `Sound` document payload, tab routing, mutation flows, removed-target fallback behavior, and the test-action behavior claimed by this slice.

## Assumptions

- Spec `038-score-object-editor-tier1-parity` is already closed, so this slice can focus on the heavyweight `Sound` editor gap only.
- The existing BSB interface work from Specs 022 and 023 is the primary reuse path for the `Sound` Interface tab.
- The `PianoRoll` and `JMask` follow-up work will live in Specs `040-pianoroll-score-object-editor` and `041-jmask-score-object-editor`, not in this slice.
