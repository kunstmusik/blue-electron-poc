# Implementation Plan: Program Settings Parity

**Branch**: `044-program-settings-parity` | **Date**: 2026-05-19 | **Spec**: [/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/specs/044-program-settings-parity/spec.md](/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/specs/044-program-settings-parity/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/specs/044-program-settings-parity/spec.md`

## Summary

Replace the current placeholder Settings surface with Java Blue program-settings parity for the active `blue-settings` panels: General, Project Defaults, Playback, Utility, Realtime Render, and Disk Render. Store program settings app-wide in a main-process-owned settings service, expose typed snapshot/update IPC to the Settings renderer, apply defaults during new project creation, consume settings in realtime playback/playhead behavior and available render workflows, and produce a usage parity matrix plus missing-feature report for unavailable Java workflows such as disk render execution or SoundObject freeze.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.8.x, React 19.x, Electron 35.x, strict renderer/main/preload packages, pure TypeScript `@blue/data` for project mutation helpers  
**Primary Dependencies**: Electron `app`/`BrowserWindow`/IPC/settings window, existing `settings-window.ts`, preload `blueAPI`, Zustand 5.x where still useful for renderer-local app preferences, `@blue/data` `BlueData`/`ProjectProperties`/`TimeState`/`Mixer`/`UDOStyle`/`TimeBase`/`SnapValueName`, existing playback store and `EngineBridge`, existing CSD export/render-command helpers, Vitest 4.x  
**Storage**: Main-process JSON settings file under the Electron user data area for Java-compatible program settings; existing renderer-persisted `blue-settings` values are migrated or retained as app-specific preferences; `.blue` project XML is only affected when Java Blue seeds new project-owned values from program settings  
**Testing**: Vitest main/shared/renderer tests, focused IPC/preload tests, settings renderer render tests, project-default application tests, realtime option/playback-store tests, `pnpm --filter @blue/app test`, `pnpm --filter @blue/app build`, `pnpm --filter @blue/data test` where data helper behavior is touched, `git diff --check`  
**Target Platform**: Electron desktop, macOS first with Java-compatible platform defaults and driver choices for macOS, Windows, Linux, and fallback platforms  
**Project Type**: Desktop application settings, Electron main/preload integration, renderer forms, and project/default/runtime integration  
**Performance Goals**: Settings open and category switches remain immediate for the small fixed panel set; settings load occurs once during app startup before project creation/playback; applying settings writes a small JSON document without blocking renderer interaction  
**Constraints**: Keep `@blue/data` UI-free and Node-free; do not serialize app settings into `.blue` files except through Java-compatible new-project defaults; preserve existing `.blue` round-trip behavior; keep current renderer settings values available through migration/retention; do not claim Text Settings parity without an active Java panel/controller  
**Scale/Scope**: Six settings panels, one app-wide settings model/store, IPC/preload contract, new project default application, realtime/playback/disk/utility usage hooks where workflows exist, usage parity matrix, missing-feature report, tests

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Data-First, UI-Separated**: PASS. Program settings are app state owned by `@blue/app`; any reusable project-default application logic remains pure and acts on `@blue/data` objects without UI dependencies.
- **Backwards-Compatible Serialization**: PASS. `.blue` XML remains unchanged except for normal project fields that Java Blue already initializes from program defaults on new project creation.
- **JVM Dependencies Preserved, Not Replaced**: PASS. Utility settings that point at freeze/SoundFont workflows are reported as dependencies if those Java-backed workflows are unavailable.
- **Engine as External Process**: PASS. Realtime playback continues through blue-engine; settings alter command/options selection rather than introducing FFI or renderer audio.
- **Test-First for Serialization**: PASS/N/A. No new `@blue/data` XML class is required; if helper tests touch project defaults, they verify existing project XML behavior is preserved.
- **Research Integration**: PASS. Java `blue-settings` panel inventory, current TypeScript settings state, and workflow gaps are recorded in `research.md`.

**Structure Decision**: Keep Settings as the existing modal Electron settings window, but move Java-compatible program settings persistence into main process so project creation and playback can consume settings before any renderer-local store is available. Use shared TypeScript types for snapshots, validation, platform defaults, and usage-matrix status. Keep existing current-app preferences either migrated into program settings where they match Java semantics or retained in the renderer settings store as app-specific preferences.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution exception is required.

## Phase 0 Research Output

See [/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/specs/044-program-settings-parity/research.md](/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/specs/044-program-settings-parity/research.md).

## Phase 1 Design Output

- [/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/specs/044-program-settings-parity/data-model.md](/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/specs/044-program-settings-parity/data-model.md)
- [/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/specs/044-program-settings-parity/contracts/program-settings-surface.md](/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/specs/044-program-settings-parity/contracts/program-settings-surface.md)

## Post-Design Constitution Check

- **Data-First, UI-Separated**: PASS. The data model separates app settings snapshots from project-owned settings, and renderer panels edit snapshots rather than reaching into project data.
- **Backwards-Compatible Serialization**: PASS. New-project default application writes normal `BlueData` properties and does not introduce app settings XML.
- **JVM Dependencies Preserved, Not Replaced**: PASS. Missing Java utility workflows are represented as missing-feature dependencies, not reimplemented inside settings work.
- **Engine as External Process**: PASS. Runtime settings feed existing blue-engine command/options construction.
- **Test-First for Serialization**: PASS/N/A. Tasks require tests around new-project default output and no unintended `.blue` settings persistence.
- **Research Integration**: PASS. Research decisions identify active Java panels, stale Text Settings resources, settings ownership, migration, and missing-feature reporting.
