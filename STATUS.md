# Project Status — blue-electron

**Date**: 2026-04-19
**Branch**: `014-window-system-parity`

## Current Active Work — Spec 014 Window System Parity

Spec `014-window-system-parity` is now implemented as the current prototype slice for auxiliary window-system parity in `blue-app`, with docs and tasks updated to match the delivered behavior.

## Spec 013 Close-Out

Spec `013-collapsed-sidebar-research` is complete as a bounded prototype and research slice.

- The 013 runtime prototype proved stable panel IDs, auxiliary-edge metadata, and a simplified edge-rail shell in `blue-app`.
- That slice intentionally did **not** claim full NetBeans RCP parity.
- Its main recommendation stands: keep dockview as the canonical panel/group host and localize custom behavior around auxiliary-group presentation state.

## Spec 014 Implemented Slice

The implemented 014 slice now provides the bounded prototype behavior for the four target panels:

- Auxiliary groups can be `docked`, `minimized`, `slideout`, or `maximized`
- Minimizing a group leaves visible ordered edge tabs on the owning edge
- Clicking a minimized tab toggles one edge-attached, resizable slide-out tool window per edge
- Docking from a slide-out docks only the selected tool, while the rail restore action docks the whole minimized group
- Maximizing a docked auxiliary group presents it with top tabs like the main editor area
- Restore returns the selected tool or group to its home edge without duplicating stable panel IDs
- Layout save/restore and Window-menu reveal must honor the existing presentation state

## What Landed

- **Canonical runtime host**: dockview remains the live host for docked and maximized auxiliary groups
- **App-owned layer**: minimized edge tabs, edge-attached slide-outs, home-edge restore metadata, stable-ID reveal routing, and parity session state
- **Prototype scope**:
  - right / `properties`: `SoundObjectPropertiesTopComponent`, `MidiInputPanelTopComponent`
  - bottom / `output`: `ScoreObjectEditorTopComponent`, `MixerTopComponent`
- **Parity-support scope**:
  - left / right / bottom edges are supported by the shell and state model
  - no left-edge Java-backed prototype tool has been assigned in this slice yet
- **Primary implementation files**:
  - `/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/packages/blue-app/src/renderer/components/workbench/auxiliary-layout.ts`
  - `/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/packages/blue-app/src/renderer/stores/workbench-store.ts`
  - `/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/packages/blue-app/src/renderer/components/workbench/WorkbenchShell.tsx`
  - `/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/packages/blue-app/src/renderer/components/workbench/AuxiliaryRail.tsx`
  - `/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/packages/blue-app/src/renderer/components/workbench/AuxiliarySlideout.tsx`
  - `/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/packages/blue-app/src/renderer/components/workbench/AuxiliaryHeaderActions.tsx`
  - `/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/packages/blue-app/src/renderer/components/workbench/DockviewPanel.tsx`
  - `/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/packages/blue-app/src/renderer/components/workbench/WindowMenu.tsx`

## Validation

- `pnpm --filter @blue/app test`: PASS
- `pnpm --filter @blue/app build`: PASS
- In-app verification confirmed the current right and bottom prototype flows are working well enough to close the slice.
- No full Java-side manual parity checklist has been completed yet, so broader UX confirmation is still follow-on.

## Immediate Follow-On

1. Run a broader manual parity pass against the Java reference UX for minimized, slide-out, maximize, and restore behavior
2. Decide which Java-backed tool or mode should seed visible left-edge parity in the next slice
3. Decide whether to broaden the same model to additional `properties` and `output` groups
4. Move workbench layout persistence from localStorage to a more durable Electron-side store if needed
