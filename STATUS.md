# Project Status — blue-electron

**Date**: 2026-04-18
**Branch**: `014-window-system-parity`

## Current Active Work — Spec 014 Window System Parity

Spec `014-window-system-parity` is now implemented as the current prototype slice for auxiliary window-system parity in `blue-app`.

## Spec 013 Close-Out

Spec `013-collapsed-sidebar-research` is complete as a bounded prototype and research slice.

- The 013 runtime prototype proved stable panel IDs, auxiliary-edge metadata, and a simplified edge-rail shell in `blue-app`.
- That slice intentionally did **not** claim full NetBeans RCP parity.
- Its main recommendation stands: keep dockview as the canonical panel/group host and localize custom behavior around auxiliary-group presentation state.

## Spec 014 Implemented Slice

The implemented 014 slice now provides the bounded prototype behavior for the four target panels:

- Auxiliary groups can be `docked`, `minimized`, `floating`, or `maximized`
- Minimizing a group leaves visible ordered edge tabs on the owning edge
- Clicking a minimized tab reopens the requested content in a floating, resizable tool window
- Maximizing an auxiliary group presents it with top tabs like the main editor area
- Restore returns the group to its home edge without duplicating stable panel IDs
- Layout save/restore and Window-menu reveal must honor the existing presentation state

## What Landed

- **Canonical runtime host**: dockview remains the live host for docked, floating, and maximized groups
- **App-owned layer**: minimized edge tabs, home-edge restore metadata, stable-ID reveal routing, and parity session state
- **Prototype scope**:
  - right / `properties`: `SoundObjectPropertiesTopComponent`, `MidiInputPanelTopComponent`
  - bottom / `output`: `ScoreObjectEditorTopComponent`, `MixerTopComponent`
- **Primary implementation files**:
  - `/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/packages/blue-app/src/renderer/components/workbench/auxiliary-layout.ts`
  - `/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/packages/blue-app/src/renderer/stores/workbench-store.ts`
  - `/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/packages/blue-app/src/renderer/components/workbench/WorkbenchShell.tsx`
  - `/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/packages/blue-app/src/renderer/components/workbench/AuxiliaryRail.tsx`
  - `/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/packages/blue-app/src/renderer/components/workbench/DockviewPanel.tsx`
  - `/Users/stevenyi/work/blue-electron/packages/blue-app/src/renderer/components/workbench/WindowMenu.tsx`

## Validation

- `pnpm --filter @blue/app test`: PASS
- `pnpm --filter @blue/app build`: PASS
- No manual in-app parity review has been completed yet, so UX confirmation against the Java app is still follow-on.

## Immediate Follow-On

1. Run a manual parity pass against the Java reference UX for minimized, floating, maximize, and restore behavior
2. Decide whether to broaden the same model to additional `properties` and `output` groups
3. Move workbench layout persistence from localStorage to a more durable Electron-side store if needed

## Related Specs

- **Spec 011**: closed; dockview was selected as the workbench foundation, with rc-dock as fallback
- **Spec 012**: closed; demo2026 parity work now matches the Java `01.csd` reference byte-for-byte
- **Spec 013**: closed; bounded auxiliary-rail prototype and implementation recommendation completed
